This project is dropped. I am continually developing bn5.

BooguNote-Web
=============

An HTML Implementation of BooguNote

Road Map:

1. Implement a basic outline editor follow BN 0.3.3.7 UI, without platform
   related functions, like "Global Paste", "File Link", "Image Thumbnail", etc. This step is only for an UI no data storage.
2. Add data storage ability. Serve notes online with plain text and
   limit rich format(Mark Down style note). Have basic user management system.
3. Can share notes.
4. Can attach file/image as a node in note.
5. Create native client based on Cef, which BN2 built on. Add more
   sophisticated features as and beyond BN 0.3.3.7 have.
